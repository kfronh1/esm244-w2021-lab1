```


#### Read in SF trees data
```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

#### Basic wrangling reminders

Find top five highest observations of trees by legal status & do some wrangling and make a graph
```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  #group by, summarize, and n in one function
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  #new name = orignal name
  relocate(tree_count) %>% 
#move location of column, this moved it to the front
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5)
# picked out top 5 highest values of tree_count

```
tree_count
